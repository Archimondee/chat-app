 * ## Dedupe middleware

 * **Options**
 *
 * - *skip* `(url, opts) => boolean`
 *
 * > If skip returns true, then the dedupe check is skipped.
 *
 * - *key* `(url, opts) => string`
 *
 * > Returns a key that is used to identify the request.
 *
 * - *resolver* `(response: Response) => Response`
 *
 * > This function is called when resolving the fetch response from duplicate calls.
 * By default it clones the response to allow reading the body from multiple sources.
